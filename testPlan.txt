TestPlan:
1. Config file reading P2
2. Region list extraction P2
3. Services count extraction P1
4. Breakdown into N per service chunks P0
5. Spawning of N services P0
6. The functionality of the spawned services P3

Suggestions:
1. Add logs
2. Make it modular. Split ETL and API Route to different classes. Split methods of json files manipulations also to
another helper class
3. Improve error messaging
